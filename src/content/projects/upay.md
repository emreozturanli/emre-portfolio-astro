## Project Overview

Upay is the core admin dashboard for **UPayments**, a comprehensive online payment solution designed to help businesses grow. It provides a unified interface for merchants to manage their entire financial operation, from invoicing to payment collection.

I played a pivotal role in developing this dashboard, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for business owners.

- **Omni-channel Support:** Ensured the dashboard is responsive and accessible, allowing merchants to "Run Your Business Anywhere."
