## Arctic Magic

Visiting Rovaniemi in December was like stepping into a winter fairytale. The entire city was blanketed in thick, pristine snow, creating a serene and magical atmosphere. We crossed the Arctic Circle and visited Santa Claus Village, which felt incredibly festive.

The highlight was definitely the husky sledding experience through the frozen forests. Although the days were short, the twilight hues of blue and pink over the snowy landscape were mesmerizing. We spent our evenings hoping for a glimpse of the Northern Lights dancing above.

## Highlights

- **Santa Claus Village** - Meeting Santa in his official hometown
