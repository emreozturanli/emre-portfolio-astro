Tokyo is a city of contrasts. Ancient temples sit beside neon-lit skyscrapers. Quiet gardens offer respite from bustling crossing.

The food scene alone is worth the trip. From hole-in-the-wall ramen shops to three-star kaiseki, every meal is an experience.

## Highlights

- **Shibuya Crossing** - The iconic scramble
- **Senso-ji Temple** - Morning visits before the crowds
- **Tsukiji Outer Market** - Fresh sushi for breakfast
